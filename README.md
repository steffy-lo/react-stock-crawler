A lightweight react component that gets stock data periodically and displays a list of stocks that crawls from right to left.
It uses the Finnhub API [(https://finnhub.io/docs/api)](https://finnhub.io/docs/api) to fetch the stock data, hence, an api key is needed to use this component which will be passed in through props.
